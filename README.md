# Learning PyTest

1. [PyTest Getting Started](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/getting-started.html)  
   pytest is a framework that makes building simple and scalable tests easy. Tests are expressive and readableâ€”no boilerplate code required. Get started in minutes with a small unit test or complex functional test for your application or library.
2. [Pytest-Sugar Beautify](https://github.com/Frozenball/pytest-sugar)
   pytest-sugar changes the default look and feel of pytest, adds a progress bar, and shows failing tests instantly. It requires no configuration; just pip install pytest-sugar, run your tests with pytest, and enjoy the prettier, more useful output.
3. [Pytest_cov Test Coverage](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov)
   pytest-cov adds coverage support for pytest to show which lines of code have been tested and which have not. It will also include the percentage of test coverage for your project.
